# GraphQL Fake Mocks

This project is about running [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/) to query GraphQL by existing schema. It also provides mocks with fake data.

## Available Commands

- `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint to check for linting errors in the `src` directory.
- `npm run build`: Compiles the TypeScript files.
- `npm start`: Runs the lint and build scripts, then starts the server using `ts-node`.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
